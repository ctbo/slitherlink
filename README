Slitherlink.hs: the solver module
solve.hs      : a main program to solve a puzzle
generate.hs   : a main program to generate a puzzle with a unique solution

Compile with

   ghc -O2 -Wall -threaded --make solve.hs
   ghc -O2 -Wall -threaded --make generate.hs

and use command line options like `+RTS -N4` to run on 4 cores.

Examples:

./solve test20x14 +RTS -N4
./generate 12 12 puzzle.eps +RTS -N4
